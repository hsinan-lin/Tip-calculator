# Tip-calculator
This tip calculator is a functioning version of the tip calculator app(UI only) from the following course: 
"Swift 5 Programming Bootcamp For Beginners" by Christian Gesty.

Besides making the app function properly, specific changes I made are as follows:
1. UI improvements, including implementing auto layout and stack views, changing the button design.
2. Tip and cost calculations are done automatically once the text fields are filled.
3. Percent label can now reflect the values of the percent slider or the percentage buttons
4. Numbers are rounded to 2 decimal places.
